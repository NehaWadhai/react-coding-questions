//A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or 
//no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

//For example, "cat" is a subsequence of "crabt".
//Example 1:

// Input: nums = [9,1,4,2,3,3,7]

// Output: 4
// Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,7], which has a length of 4.
