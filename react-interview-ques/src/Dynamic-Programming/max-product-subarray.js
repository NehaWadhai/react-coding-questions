//given array of integers, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number)
// which has the largest product.
//A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

//You can assume the output will fit into a 32-bit integer.

//Example 1:

//Input: nums = [1,2,-3,4]
