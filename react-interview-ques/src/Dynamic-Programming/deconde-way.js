//Need tp decode string where A=1, B=2,... Z=26
//To decode a message, digits must be grouped and then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above. There may be multiple ways to decode a message. For example, "1012" can be mapped into:

//"JAB" with the grouping (10 1 2)
//"JL" with the grouping (10 12)
